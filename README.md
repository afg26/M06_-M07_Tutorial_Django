Domain:
Domain names were created so people could more easily access a website’s Internet Protocol (IP).
A domain is essentially a website’s home and when you want to register your domain, you can choose from these above steps:

Select a domain registrar
Choose the best domain name
Check the availability of your domain name
Select your domain extension
Purchase your domain


Hosting an application:

Application hosting provides a web-enabled service that allows an application to be made available online.
While we think of hosting our application, we need to consider processing power, data storage, user access, software licensing, bandwidth, and other factors.
The main components of mobile app hosting are:
Storage
Bandwidth
Platforms
Security
Some web application hosting service providers are:
AWS, Heroku, Google cloud platform, Apache tomcat, Digital ocean, Microsoft Azure and the list goes on.

If I have to host my application I would choose AWS or Microsoft Azure because they have the best options to choose and there security is better than others and they do have reasonable prices.
